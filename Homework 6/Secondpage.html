        <h2>The Story of the Brandy</h2>
        <p>There was once a woman lived in a little old town on the edge of western bay. At least a hundred ships would come each day to that bay, into the same bar, to talk with their fellow captains about where they have been and where they were from. The woman worked in that bar and served whiskey glass after whiskey glass barely listening to all the fellows sweet talk. Something else was always on her mind. With every outfit she puts on, she always wears this silver braided chain. She has said it was made in the North of Spain. On the chain is locket, and inside it bears the name of the man that this woman once loved. They say that he came back in the summer with gifts from far away, telling beautiful stories. Powerful enough to where you could feel the ocean fall and rise. But he made it clear that he couldnt stay. He couldnt call this harbor home. The woman did her best to understand. But you still see her hold the locket tight in her hand. As she walks home in this silent town, the woman thinks back fondly and can still here him say,</p>
        <p>Brandy, youre a fine girl. What a good wife you would be. But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea.</p>
